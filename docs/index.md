# Yiyang Sun

Hello, I'm Yiyang Sun, a frontend enthusiast, undergraduate of UESTC and currently frontend intern in [@bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/).

Author of [hexo theme linear](https://github.com/syy11cn/hexo-theme-linear) and [vitepress theme linear](https://github.com/syy11cn/vitepress-theme-linear). Happy to see anyone try out my blog themes.

I will write my blog posts mainly in English, and there may be some in Chinese (followed by a <sup>中文</sup> label). I'd like to practice my English by writing.

[Communicate with me](mailto:syy11cn@outlook.com) if you want.
